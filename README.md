# Copula-Histogram

## Introduction
We develop a noval framework that fits copulas on Histogram-valued data. A copula is often used to link marginal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) to a joint multivairate CDF. In the scenarios with histogram-valued data, we apply the copula theory to recover the underlying distributions from the hisrograms, which can be considered as a parametric distribution estimation method instead of the traditional non-parametric empirical estimations. See Jin, H., *Copula Theory on the Histogram-valued Data* (Doctoral dissertation, University of Georgia).

## R Code
The source code for the relevant functions is in copula-Histogram/Copula_functions.R. A demo is shown in copula-Histogram/histcopula.Rmd. If a sample code is preferred, one can refer to copula-Histogram/code_copula.
